Project Description: In Environment, I created three separate areas. A mountainous tribal area, a modern home,
and a fantasy themed backyard. The music I used was a area theme from the game Myst, a song from Stan Getz, and the theme
for Tomb Raider I. The lights within the house turn on and off based on what floor you're in/on. I added terrain to make
it look nicer and to give me more textures and spacial environments to work with.
